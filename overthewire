### Bandit Level 0 → Level 1

First we need to connect to the Over the Wire Bandit game with SSH port 2220. You will need a SSH client. 
For Linux I suggest Gnome Connection Manager and for Windows I suggest Putty.

Host name is bandit.labs.overthewire.org 
User: bandit0
password: bandit0

The best tool to use to read about Linux commands is the man pages. To use man pages you simply type; man <command name>
Example: man ls

Commands used for this level:
ls  – List information about the FILE’s (the current directory by default).

The two most common  arguments used with ls are:
ls -a – view all files including hidden files that start with .
ls -l – view long list format of files.

cat – used to view contents of a file.

Step 1.
After logging in type ls
 You will see a file named readme

Step 2.
  Type cat readme
  The contents of the file has the password for level 1 in it.
