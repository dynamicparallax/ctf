### Bandit Level 0 → Level 1

First we need to connect to the Over the Wire Bandit game with SSH port 2220. You will need a SSH client. 
For Linux I suggest Gnome Connection Manager and for Windows I suggest Putty.

Host name is bandit.labs.overthewire.org 
User: bandit0
password: bandit0

The best tool to use to read about Linux commands is the man pages. To use man pages you simply type; man <command name>
Example: man ls

Commands used for this level:
ls  – List information about the FILE’s (the current directory by default).

The two most common  arguments used with ls are:
ls -a – view all files including hidden files that start with .
ls -l – view long list format of files.

cat – used to view contents of a file.

Step 1.
After logging in type ls
 You will see a file named readme

Step 2.
  Type cat readme
  The contents of the file has the password for level 1 in it.

### Bandit Level 1 → Level 2

Viewing files with dashed (-) filenames.

Host name is bandit.labs.overthewire.org 
User: bandit1
password: boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1

Commands used for this level:
cat – used to view contents of a file.
ls – List information about the FILE’s (the current directory by default).

Step 1.
After logging in type ls
 You will see a file named –

Step 2.
Now from the last level we might think that typing cat – would allow you to view the contents of the file, but it wont.

Usage of dash (-) in place of a filename
Using - as a filename to mean stdin/stdout is a convention that a lot of programs use. When cat sees the string – as a filename, it treats it as a synonym for stdin.
What will happen in our case is cat – echoes stdin, in this case keyboard user input, to stdout, the terminal window. Go ahead and try it to see what happens.
(if you are stuck after doing this press CTRL C to exit back to bash prompt).

The other problem is that Linux command options usually start with a dash ( - ). If you try to type that filename on a command line, the command might think you’re trying to type a command option.

To get around this, you need to alter the way that cat sees the file as a regular file by “hiding” the dash from cat. The best way to do this is to cat directly to the file location by prefixing the filename with ./ or /home/bandit1/. ./ means “look in the current directory”. and /home/bandit1/ means “look in directory /home/bandit1.

Type cat ./-
  The contents of the file has the password for level 2 in it.

### Bandit Level 2 → Level 3

Dealing with files with spaces in the file name.

Host name is bandit.labs.overthewire.org 
User: bandit2
password: CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9

Commands used for this level:
cat – used to view contents of a file.
ls – List information about the FILE’s (the current directory by default).

Step 1.
After logging in type ls
 You will see a file named spaces in this filename

 Step 2.
Linux does not handle spaces in file names well so if you do type
cat spaces in this filename, cat will think you are trying to view the contents of file spaces, file in, file this, 
and file filename and those separate files do not exist.

One of the reasons Linux does not handle spaces in file names is that bash scripting uses spaces as a NULL terminator 
to break a script at a certain point. It is considered a best practice to not use spaces in filenames in Linux, 
underscores (_) are generally used in place of spaces. spaces_in_this_filename would be a better way to name this file 
if you where to create it.

To get around this we need to “hide” the spaces from cat, just like in the Level 1. To do this we simply type a backslash (\) 
in the filename before each space.

Type cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename.
The contents of the file has the password for level 3 in it.

Another quick way around typing the full filename out is to use the TAB key. The TAB key in Linux and most command line 
interperters is used to auto complete the full filename or full command name from only the first few characters being entered.
We could have just done cat s and pressed the TAB key and it would auto complete the filename with backslashes in it for us.
cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename

Using the TAB key only works if the filename has enough distinct characters in it for the system to auto complete the filename. 
If we had other files in this directory with names like spaces in and spaces, for auto complete to work for our file spaces in 
this filename we would need to type cat spaces in t then press TAB to auto complete the file we want to cat.

### Bandit Level 4 → Level 5

Find human readable files and dealing with dashed (-) file names.

Host name is bandit.labs.overthewire.org 
User: bandit4
password: pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFgAB

Commands used for this level:
ls – List information about all the file’s include hidden files that start with (.).
cd – change directory
du – estimate file space usage
file – determine file type
cat – used to view contents of a file.
| – this is the pipe command and used to pass info from one command to another.

Step 1.
After logging in type ls
 You will see a directory named inhere (you can tell its a directory instead of a file because it is a different color).

Step 2.
  Type ls and we will see multiple files that start with a dash. We need to find the only human readable file. Before we
  do that lets type man du to learn what du does. We will see that du estimates file space and when used with the -h will
  print sizes in human readable format.

Now that we know we need to use du -h we need to use file command at the same time to find that human readable file. What 
we do is use the pipe command to pipe the du command into the file command. We also need to deal with the dashed (-) file 
name so we need to tell file command to work in the current directory by typing ./ just like we did in level one.

Type du -h | file ./*     (the * is used as a wildcard to search all files)

./-file00: data
./-file01: data
./-file02: data
./-file03: data
./-file04: data
./-file05: data
./-file06: data
./-file07: ASCII text
./-file08: data
./-file09: data
We find that -file07 is the human readable ASCII file.

Step 3.

Now all we need to do is cat -file07, but remember we are dealing with a dashed file name so we need to tell cat the exact place of the file by using ./

Type cat ./-file07 and the password for level 5 is displayed.
